This has been speculated to be based on a distance-dependent interaction between his body and surfaces, known as the van der Waals force,[113] though in the 2002 Spider-Man film, his hands and feet are lined with tiny clinging cilia in the manner of a real spider's feet. Spider-Man's other powers include superhuman strength, agility, and balance and a precognitive sixth sense referred to as his \"spider-sense\", which alerts him to danger.[",
